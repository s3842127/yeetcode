# Services


## Backend
This is the Backend Posts Service. It is responsible for talking to the Posts DB, and exposing an internal HTTP API for managing Posts.

### Environment Variables
| Environment Variable | Purpose                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| PORT                 | Which port will the service listen on for HTTP requests |
| DB_USER              | Username for connecting to the Backend DB               |
| DB_PASSWORD          | Password for connecting to the Backend DB               |
| DB_HOST              | Hostname/Network address for the Backend DB             |

### Image
The Backend service image is available at `rmitdominichynes/sdo-2025:backend`.

### Dependencies
The Backend service depends on a PostgreSQL database, with the required migrations. An image for this has been provided, available at `rmitdominichynes/sdo-2025:db`.

### Database Configuration
The PostgreSQL Databse container also requires some environment variables to be configured.

|  Environment Variable        |  Purpose                                                  |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|  POSTGRES_USER               | Username for the Backend Service to use to connect        |
|  POSTGRES_PASSWORD           | Password for the Backend Service to use to connect        |
|  POSTGRES_DB                 | "posts"                                                   |

## Frontend
This is the Frontend Posts Service. It is responsible for serving a UI to users over HTTP. This UI allows them to view and manage Posts.

### Environment Variables
| Environment Variable | Purpose                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| PORT                 | Which port will the service listen on for HTTP requests |
| BACKEND_URL          | Fully qualified URL for reaching the Backend Service    |

### Image
The Frontend service image is available at `rmitdominichynes/sdo-2025:frontend`.


# Running The Services Locally (In Docker)
1. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the two services, and a postgres database container.
2. View the Frontend Posts Service at `http://localhost:8081`, and the Backend Posts Service at `http://localhost:8080`.

# Deploying The Services

The services can be deployed to EC2. 

Each container needs: 
- The correct environment variables configured (refer to the above sections)
- Security Groups will need to be configured to allow traffic to reach the instances. 
    - They will also need to be configured to allow the instances to talk to each other, if the services are deployed on different instances.
    - The PostgreSQL database receives inbound traffic on port `5432`
    - The ports used by the Backend and Frontend services are configurable through the `PORT` environment variable. Otherwise, it will default to port `8081`.
